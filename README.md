# Cahn-Hilliard-Spinodal-in-Kotlin
Problem:
In this project, we consider the spinodal decomposition in a virtual A-B alloy. This port shows a two-dimensional phase-field simulation of the spinodal decomposition using the Cahn-Hilliard equation.

Objective:
The main objective is to reprogram the existing spinodal decomposition code, originally written in another programming language, into Kotlin. Additionally, we aim to develop a mobile application that can simulate the spinodal decomposition process, making it accessible on mobile devices.
